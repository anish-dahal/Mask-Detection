Mask-Detection using RestNet

## Dataset
I have created a model that detects face mask trained on 7553 images with 3 color channels (RGB).

Data set consists of 7553 RGB images in 2 folders as with_mask and without_mask. Images are named as label with_mask and without_mask. Images of faces with mask are 3725 and images of faces without mask are 3828.
